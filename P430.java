Write an application to preÂ­sell a limited number of cinema tickets. 
Each buyer can buy as many as 4 tickets. No more than 100 tickets can be sold. 
Implement a program called TicketSeller that prompts the user for the desired number of tickets and then displays the number of remaining tickets. 
Repeat until all tickets have been sold, and then display the total number of buyers.
